## Features

- Upload an image for object detection.
- Capture an image using the web interface for object detection.
- Display detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.
- List detected items in a table.

## Usage
Make sure you have docker istalled,  otherwise you need to follow this step:
1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tinapyp/object-detection-detectron2.git
    cd object-detection-detectron2
    ```

2. Install packages
    ``` sh
    pip install -U torch torchvision
    pip install cython pyyaml
    pip install -U 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI'
    python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run App
    ```sh

## Configuration
### Model Configuration

- The model configuration is specified in the `saved_model/efficient-det.yaml` file.
- The model weights are stored in `saved_model/model.pth`.

### Class Names

- The class names for the objects are defined in the `class_names` list in `app.py`.

### Metadata Registration

- Metadata is registered for the custom dataset with class names in `app.py`.
